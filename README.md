# Password-Generator
A fairly advanced Password Generator that avoid 1000 common passwords and gives the user different input options to generate the best password for the user!
# Advanced Password Generator

## Overview

This Python script is an advanced password generator designed to create secure passwords while avoiding common patterns, dictionary words, and user-defined patterns. The script also allows you to specify a list of common passwords to avoid by providing the path to a file, and it can remember this path for future runs.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Generation:** Users can specify the length of the password and whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Pattern Avoidance:** The script can avoid specific patterns, such as sequences, repeated characters, common substitutions (e.g., "p@ssw0rd"), and dictionary words.
- **User-Defined Patterns:** Users can input custom patterns that the password should avoid.
- **Common Passwords File:** The script can load a list of common passwords from a specified file and avoid generating any of these passwords.
- **Path Persistence:** The script remembers the path to the common passwords file between runs, making it more convenient for repeated use.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-password-generator.git


## 2. Install Required Dependencies:

The script requires the nltk library to check for dictionary words. Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code

```bash
pip install nltk```

Download NLTK Word Data:

The script will automatically download the necessary NLTK data on the first run. Ensure you have an internet connection for this.

### 3. Usage

Running the Script
You can run the script using Python:

```bash
python Advpasswordgen.py


## 4. User Interactions

The script interacts with the user in the following ways:

Specify the Path to Common Passwords File:

On the first run, the script will ask for the path to the common_passwords.txt file, where you should provide a file containing common passwords to avoid. The file should contain one password per line.
Example: /Users/yourusername/Desktop/common_passwords.txt
The script will save this path for future use. On subsequent runs, it will use the saved path unless the file is moved or deleted.
Input Custom Patterns:

After specifying the path to the common passwords file (or using the remembered path), the script will prompt you to input custom patterns that you want the password generator to avoid.
You can enter multiple patterns one by one. Press Enter without typing anything to finish entering patterns.
Example patterns: admin, 1234, password
Specify Password Criteria:

The script will ask you to specify the desired length of the password and whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Example inputs:
Length: 12
Include uppercase letters? y
Include numbers? y
Include special characters? y
Password Generation:

The script will generate a password based on your criteria and validate it against the common passwords, dictionary words, and patterns you specified.
If it cannot generate a valid password after 2000 attempts, it will return the last attempted password.
Output:

The generated password will be displayed on the console.
Example output: Generated Secure Password: X4g7K5m2gS
Customizing the Script
Changing the Maximum Attempts:

The max_attempts variable in the generate_secure_password function controls how many times the script will try to generate a valid password before giving up. You can adjust this value to suit your needs.
Common Passwords File:

If you need to change the path to the common_passwords.txt file, simply delete the config.txt file in the script directory, and the script will prompt you for a new path on the next run.
